# Binary Search Algorithm
# Create a random list of numbers between 0 and 100 with a difference of 2 between each number.
# Ask the user for a number between 0 and 100 to check whether their number is in the list.
# The programme should work like this.
# The programme will half the list of numbers and see whether the users number matches the middle element in the list.
# If they do not match, the programme will check which half the number lies in, and eliminate the other half.
# The search then continues on the remaining half,
# again checking whether the middle element in that half is equal to the userâ€™s number.
# This process keeps on going until the programme finds the users number, or until the size of the subarray is 0,
# which means the users number isn't in the list.
